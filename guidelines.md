**NOTE 3 June 2021**

##anime on Libera.Chat is a new channel that reunites freenode's #anime and ##anime. Ops from both channels agreed to share a home on Libera with these conditions

- Ops from both communities will be ops in the new channel (see list further below)
- We'll start with #anime's guidelines.md but expect to iterate on it over time
- We'll revisit aspects of how we moderate and work on getting more community input

Notably, we're not carrying bans over from the other network. There'll still be boundaries, but we're feeling out how they'll change compared to #anime on freenode. Please let us know if you have input!

# Guidelines

Be respectful and courteous! That's the root of it. Some examples of respectful and courteous behavior include:

- Tagging NSFW links as NSFW (especially when they are erotic or gory)
- Not posting NSFW content too frequently. Some rules of thumb: There probably shouldn't be more than 2-3 NSFW links on the screen at one time, and one person probably shouldn't be posting more than a few NSFW links in a day. This channel isn't a pornography image board.
- Tagging spoilers. Preferably with ANSI color codes and a message indicating what game/show you're spoiling, but if your client doesn't support those (use google or ask) just type SPOILERS or something
- Not spamming or flooding. A good rule of thumb is "one thought per line" and ASCII art doesn't count as a thought
- Not abusing bots. Don't add/delete random quotes from other users, and don't flood the channel by using a ton of bot commands.
- Not using slurs. Aside from being unwelcoming, using them puts the channel on a slippery slope to degenerating into another internet shithole
- Stopping or moving heated/uncomfortable discussions when asked (this happens a lot with religion, politics, and NSFW discussions). Give ##anime-offtopic or PMs a try

This list is far from exhaustive, but the general theme is "don't be a dick". If you feel someone is acting out, feel free to ping an op (or all of us by saying "!ops"). We'll generally try to communicate before doing anything, but if you feel you are wrongly quieted or banned, head over to ##anime-help to chat with the us. Keep in mind that moderation is heavily contextual and highly discretionary, and that we can only moderate what we see so you may have to ping us (!ops).

Finally, a couple notes around moderation in the channel:

- Please don't gossip about users who got moderated. We're often privy to additional context that you haven't seen, and talking about users without that context could unfairly stain their reputation (or ours) and generally sullies the mood. If you have concerns, please share them in ##anime-help
- Please don't try to back-seat moderate or clarify things on our behalf. We'd like to control the tone we set in the channel, so apart from reiterating content from the guidelines please defer to us

# Ops

We have them.

- Aurora_v_kosmose
- davic
- dfch
- emmeka
- KatrinValerie
- mathu
- Nanobot
- Sadale
- Smeef
- theholyduck
- Vohveli

There is no single lead op. Each op has the authority to use their discretion on any matters they feel need immediate attention. Ops will often discuss issues among themselves and come to longer-term decisions as a group. Nanobot has +F, but that's just because someone has to.

### \#\#anime-help

We have it.

It's where you go if you want to get ops' attention. This channel has +z set, which means only ops can read your messages (but everyone can read ops' messages). You can use this channel to appeal a ban or quiet, to report misbehavior in ##anime, to voice concerns about how the channel is being run, or to re-raise an issue if you feel it wasn't covered well enough the first time. Bring logs if you can!

Only join this channel if you have something to say and please part when you're done; we want people not to feel like there are spectators when they're chatting with us.

# Bots

We have them.

- [ImoutoBot](https://github.com/freenode-anime/stuff/blob/master/bots.md#imoutobot) (owned by Nanobot) controls anime/manga of the week, maintains a quote database for users and announces their joining to the channel with a random one, searches for anime with !a, has !seen to show when a user was last present, has "!later tell" to deliver messages to users the next time they appear, and !c for calculator/conversions/answers.
- [Suzuka](https://github.com/freenode-anime/stuff/blob/master/bots.md#suzuka) (owned by davic) serves as a robotic ops assistant that auto-quiets spammers and redirects people who join too much (spam or broken connection) to ##anime-help
- [Enju](https://github.com/freenode-anime/stuff/blob/master/bots.md#enju) (owned by davic) posts titles from links in the channel, searches searx with _g, currency etc.

Want to bring your bot into the channel? We probably don't want you to! Feel free to ask the ops in ##anime-help if you feel it could offer something good to the channel, but we generally say no because people abuse bots.

# Automod Actions

As a countermeasurement against spam, Suzuka performs op actions automatically, which includes the following:

- Temporarily quieting the users who post multiple messages rapidly. The quiet would last for a few minutes.
- Temporarily banning the users who join the channels multiple times rapidly. The ban would last for an hour.

If you got quieted or banned for no apparent reason, don't worry. Chances are that it's an automod action. In case it happens to you, please wait patiently and you'll be able to talk in the channel again. Alternatively, you could ask for unquiet/unban in ##anime-help. Assuming that you're not spamming intentionally, you will likely to get unquieted/unbanned if there's any op being available.
